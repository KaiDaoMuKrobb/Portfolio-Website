                    <p>Third Place in Science Project Presentation 2023 & Presenter at the Booth for the Year 6 Parents Meeting 2023</p>
                    <p>A voice commanded lamp created to support, enhance safety and increase the overall convenience of people especially with disabilities and the elderly in their daily lives. For a project, we acquired a Raspberry Pi-4 and used Python as our coding language. We used Google AI for speech recognition before replacing the lamp's bulbs with a breadboard containing multiple LEDs. We also purchased a microphone for voice commands and a white foam board for decoration. My responsibilities in this project included assisting in code development, research, and serving as the lead presenter for the Science Day Presentation. We have successfully created a voice-controlled lamp capable of recognize phrases such as "Lamp on," "Lamp off," and adjust brightness by commanding specified percentage values such as "Lamp 20%."</p>

                    <p>First Place in Game Making Competition 2023</p>
                    <p>We entered our school's competition to write Python code for Pong Game. There are many ways of making this game, but the key to our victory was the addition of complexity by allowing the player to select the mode and difficulty level. We looked up the methods for making a Pong game online, there were both simple and advanced. Following that, we worked to brainstorm and write this program.</p>

                    <p>This camp gave me a chance to experience university life, study, participate in activities, and make a wide range of new connections. This camp taught me the basics of coding languages and teamwork. I was taught some computer languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and completed projects for the first time using those skills. It was because of this camp that I fell in love with KMUTT. </p>

                    <p>The school provided students with the opportunity to visit KMUTT for an exclusive tour, lessons, and workshops. I and a friend made an automobile together. For the robot to do the duties, we must enter the correct commands. I also received a KMUTT CPE resin keychain with my name imprinted on it. </p>

                    <h3>Electricity</h3>
                    <p>The Most Promising Project 2022: A bicycle that can generate electricity. A bicycle that can generate electricity. The idea aimed to combine ecology and exercise, resulting in a practical solution for both energy conservation and personal well-being. The project are able to work effectively and be able to charge mobile gadgets and lights. As we begin cycling, the motion of the chain will drive a motor attached to the back wheel, causing electricity to be generated. The current will then flow through the cables until it reaches the power transformer, which will regulate the output to a constant 12 volts. We can transform this power into 220 volts using an inverter, creating enough electricity to charge various electrical devices.</p>
